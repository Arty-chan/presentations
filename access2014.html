						<p>Morning everyone. I hope yesterday’s panel on usability and accessibility got you thinking about how you might improve your web services. This presentation should provide some broader context and more of a quick overview.</p>

						<h2>What is Accessibility?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Okay, so we’re here to talk about accessibility, but what <em>is</em> accessibility?</p>
							<p>One definition, and what seems to be the most common one is that</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Quick show of hands, how many of you would say that more or less aligns with your own definition? (okay, good to know)</p>
							<p>With a working definition, we can then ask:</p>

						<h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>People with a disability are a minority, and not all of them need special consideration for accessibility purposes, right? While that may be true,</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Disability > Minority</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Policy</p>
						<p class="fragment">Legislation</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The number of people with a disability is larger than any one group of ethnic or visible minority. This is true in both Canada and the United States.</p>
							<p>That’s a lot of people.</p>
							<p>Many organizations also have guidelines or policies around equal or equivalent access to all users, and depending on your location or type of organization, there may also be legislation that applies.</p>
							<p>You might be convinced, but what about others?</p>

						<h2>Getting Buy-in</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>People frequently ask me how to get buy-in from others, because they might be convinced that we should care about accessibility and do something about it, but too often, accessibility is put aside because it’s too difficult, time consuming, or due to a belief that “accessible websites are ugly.”</p>
							<p>On a side note, this last excuse is not true. I mean yes, some accessible websites are ugly, but in the same way that some websites are ugly regardless of the level of accessibility. If anything, the most accessible websites I’ve reviewed or worked on have been fairly pleasing to the eye. Just check out <a href="http://gov.uk">gov.uk</a></p>

							<ul>
								<li>reflect institutional mission, leadership, and values, - okay assuming your institution has something about equal access</li>
								<li>serve all users,</li>
								<li>make sound fiscal policy, - since it improves efficiency and reduces costs while maintaining quality, avoids retrofitting, inequitable solutions, litigation; frequently fulfills grant/contract requirements - and</li>
								<li>add value to the institution. - because you have a better website, it benefits more people (e.g. captions to help people with varying language skills), loads more quickly in browsers, requires less bandwidth, is easier to maintain and update, tends to have a higher return in search engines, and higher compatibility with various software and hardware.</li>

						<h2>Accessibility at Work</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>A quick exercise: I want you to think about the work that you have been involved with; doesn’t have to be at your current organization, nor does it have to be web services related; where accessibility was a consideration, or even just mentioned. It’s not a lot of time, but I’ll give you 30 seconds to think back.</p>

								<li>accessibility was thought about and actively considered throughout the process<br>
								Please keep your hands up, so we can add to the group.</li>
								<li>accessibility became a consideration late in the process, but was actively worked on</li>

						<h2>Approach to Accessibility</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Whether you or your team wants to, or because you’re told to, half the battle seems to simply be figuring out your approach.</p>
							<p>If, like many others, you see accessibility as something at the end of a checklist, then that’s when you’ll deal with it. However, at least two usability/accessibility experts tell us to:</p>

						<h2>Designing for Assistive Technology</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>obviously, your service needs to be both usable and accessible.</p>

							<p>Say as part of your approach, you want to make sure your service is accessible to all assistive technology. You start with ‘screen readers’ on your list,  and do some searching and start adding, other ‘text-to-speech’ software, ‘screen magnifiers’, ‘joysticks’, what about ‘mobile devices’ with the added accessibility features?

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>So how do you design for accessibility, if that includes all technology? You don’t.</p>
							<p>What we need to do is change the way we think about accessibility, and move towards universal design.</p>

					<h2>Ask Your Users</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I would probably still start with the broader perspective and reminder that you need to be doing the different types of exercises, tests, and studies, whereby you get your users involved as much as possible.</p>
						<p>Throughout the process, the idea is to keep in mind that your users and the way they access and interact with your services are very diverse. (James spoke to this yesterday as well).</p>

					<h2>Some “Special” Considerations</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>While making use of best practices and comforming to a good set of guidelines, such as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>, (along with everything else) should be enough, there are a few considerations that I want to cover because they are commonly missed or not thought about.</p>
						<p>Let’s start with</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Keyboard Accessibility</h3>
					<img src="http://cynng.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/wp-theme-input-focus.png" alt="search field with outline" class="fragment">

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Websites should always be fully accessible by a keyboard. Interactive elements should be navigable and controllable by keyboard, keyboard shortcuts should not override default behaviour, and users should always know where they are.</p>
						<p>For example, visual cues for input focus help your users regardless of whether they only use a keyboard or not, but are necessary for keyboard only users.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Skip Links</h3>
					<pre class="fragment"><code data-trim class="html">
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;a class="hide-text" href="#main"&gt;Skip to Main Content&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;nav role="navigation"&gt;
	// Menu
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;div id="main" role="main"&gt;
	 // Content
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
					</code></pre>
					<cite class="fragment">Schofield, M. (2014). ARIA for the Spec Impaired. <a href="http://ns4lib.com/aria-primer/">http://ns4lib.com/aria-primer/</a></cite>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Ideally, your source order actually has your menu below your content, but if you're constrained, skip links are useful for both keyboard only, and screen reader users. Skip links are simple links that allow users to skip repeated parts of your website, such as your header or menu.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>ARIA</h3>
					<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite</a></p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code data-trim class="html">
&lt;nav role="navigation"&gt;
	// Menu
&lt;/nav&gt;
					</code></pre>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The role attribute that you see as part of the nav and main content div is part of the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, or ARIA. Basically, it’s a way to add attributes to your code to make your site more accessible by telling a screen reader what ‘role’ your elements play.</p>
						<p>So, “navigation” says this is where the main menu or navigation is.</p>
						<p>You need to do some research on when to use these, and I have some ARIA resources listed.</p>

						<h3>Media</h3>

							<li class="fragment">Images: alt=""</li>
							<li class="fragment">Audio: transcript</li>
							<li class="fragment">Video: transcript</li>
							<li class="fragment">Video: captions</li>
							<li class="fragment">Video: descriptive audio</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Last but not least, let’s talk about media.</p>
							<p>Media should have a text alternative. This is generally fairly straightforward.</p>
							<p>For images, most people are familiar with alt text, and I’ll talk about this more later.</p>
							<p>Audio should have transcripts.</p>
							<p>For videos, transcripts will also work, but should have captions,</p>
						</aside>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>and ideally, a descriptive audio track (example video, NEED 8 minutes left).</p>
							<p>One of the most problematic issues (and irritating too) is media that automatically starts playing.</p>

							<p>Except, less than a year ago, a list of top 10 academic library websites was posted and when I checked last week, 6/10 had a carousel (which is less than I predicted), 5/6 autoplay</p>

						<h2>Death to the Carousel</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>By the way, this is inspired by should i use a carousel dot com, where I wrote a blog post about the issues carousels typically have including frequently a lack of keyboard accessibility.</p>
							<p>Okay, I admit that it is possible to create an accessible carousel, and they already exist (such as slick), but they are rarely used, or used in an inaccessible manner. I’m not actually telling you never to use them, but to really think hard about how and why you’re using one.</p>

					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I mentioned a testing framework earlier, QuailJS, and there are others, sometimes built into software, such as Eclipse. However, if you’re not comfortable with testing frameworks, you could choose a set of assessment tools, of which there are two types.</p>
						<p>Simulation tools allow you to simulate certain conditions or environments. For example, VisCheck takes images and simulates colour blindness. (Vischeck also provides a tool called Daltonize, which attempts to correct images.). There are also some screen reader emulators, such as Fangs.</p>
						<p>Evaluation tools allow you to check conformance to guidelines. For example,</p>
						<ul>
							<li>HTML Codesniffer (bookmarklet) - check against WCAG, including when logged in</li>
							<li>WCAG Contrast Checker (Firefox plugin)</li>
							<li>WAVE Toolbar - view as text-only, outline only, etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>(As Jeff covered yesterday,) Passing all of these tests does not mean that your website is actually accessible or usable. Nothing can replace actual user and usability testing throughout  development.</p>
						<p>Remember when I talked about getting buy-in? Invite staff to watch user testing, and if that’s not possible, playback meaningful clips of what users say and do at a meeting and/or post them on your intranet. When you’re trying to convince staff of certain decisions, user voices are frequently the most powerful evidence. By posting your user results and other deliverables, such as mockups, you get the added bonus of being transparent in your process.</p>

						<h2>Guidelines for Your Content Creators</h2>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Be clear and concise</li>
							<li class="fragment">Use headers and tables properly</li>
							<li class="fragment">Use descriptive links</li>
							<li class="fragment">Describe images if needed</li>
							<li class="fragment">Make and choose videos with captions, and add a link if you embed them</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>With the rise of the CMS, fewer organizations have a single person writing content for the website. When staff in an organization are restricted within their roles on a CMS, there is no reason that staff members should not be empowered to write and edit the content for the areas they are responsible for, and fix minor errors in other areas.</p>
							<p>While you cannot control what other people write, you can encourage best practices by providing a few simple guidelines. By giving staff examples and resources, you can build content best practices into the writing process.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Be clear and concise - because users don’t want to read whole paragraphs to get the answer they want</li>
								<li>Use headers and tables properly - I tell them to use headers like they would in a report, and tables should only be for displaying data (not for layout purposes)</li>
								<li>Use descriptive links - pretending the only context a user has is what page they’re on</li>
								<li>Describe images if needed e.g. alt text decision flow chart</li>
								<li>Last but not least, Make and choose videos with captions, and add a link if you embed them</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Emphasize that the guidelines are for everyone’s benefit, and that the accessibility and usability of content is a shared responsibility.</p>

					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Now that your staff have some guidance, what about your users? While not required, one of the great ways to be transparent and show your organization’s efforts in supporting equitable access is to have an accessibility statement.</p>
						<p>It also helps to clarify for users what to expect depending on how much of your service relies on third-party services.</p>
						<p>WCAG includes a section on writing conformance claims, and the Access 8878 site also provides a template based on the UK’s BS 8878 Web Accessibility Code of Practice</p>
