						<h2>Journey Sheet</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Flowcharts and task analyses work well when you know and understand the whole process, but what happens when you don’t? Obviously, you need something that helps you identify all the steps in a workflow.</p>
							<p>Honestly, there is probably an actual name for this method of looking at workflows, but I could not find one, so I have come to call them journey sheets.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/book-journey-blank.png" alt="example blank journey sheet">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The idea is that you have a sheet of paper which will go from one person to the next, and as it passes to each person, they write down their name and their tasks. This method works particularly well if you have a specific item, print or digital, that the journey sheet follows.</p>
						</aside>

						<h3>Types of Material</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Hardcover</li>
							<li class="fragment">Trade Paperpack</li>
							<li class="fragment">Children's Fiction</li>
							<li class="fragment">Children's Non-Fiction</li>
							<li class="fragment">Magazine</li>
							<li class="fragment">Newspaper</li>
							<li class="fragment">DVD</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>When we did this exercise at my work, we were looking at the workflow for new materials in how they are handled and processed, so we did a journey sheet for each type of material:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Hardcover (with and without hold)</li>
								<li>Trade Paperpack</li>
								<li>Children's Fiction</li>
								<li>Children's Non-Fiction</li>
								<li>Magazine</li>
								<li>Newspaper</li>
								<li>DVD</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We opted not to do CD or audiobook, because we knew it was a similar process as DVD, nor mass market paperback since it's similar to trade paperback, but even simpler, and I did not want to overwhelm staff with how many we were doing.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

						<img src="images/book-journey-example.jpg" alt="example completed journey sheet">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The sheets themselves have brief instructions and an example at the top, with information on who to contact. Once left with the staff member who does receiving, the sheets were attached as soon as an appropriate item came in and followed the item throughout the process until it was shelved in the public area, at which time the sheets were returned to me. One of the reasons I decided on journey sheets was because part of the process involves another department and involves many different staff members, so the journey sheets seemed like the easiest way to see what was happening with material.</p>
							<p>Some people have asked me about having staff put a date as to when they receive it, which is certainly an option. However, in our case, we were more concerned with the process rather than how long the process took, and we did not want staff to feel as if the speed of their work was being evaluated. So, really, it depends on whether timing is something you want to review.</p>
							<p>If you decide to use this method, be warned that sheets may get lost, so you will want a contingency plan of how to handle what happens. The one sheet we thought lost was accidentally kept with the book, so it came back weeks later when the borrower returned the book.</p>
							<p>After the sheets were completed, I did a bit of analysis. What was most interesting was seeing how many people handled an item. In many places, the number of people handling an item is not necessarily an issue where items stay on trucks and are simply wheeled from one person to the next. However, at my workplace, due to space constraints, the less people that handle an item, the less time is potentially wasted simply moving an item from one person to the next, especially in Technical Services.</p>
							<p>A journey sheet can be used with digital items as well, as long as it’s clear which item the sheet is “attached” to, and that the sheet moves along with it.</p>
