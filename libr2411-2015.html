						<p>That’s actually the take home message for today, so that's it. We can all go home now, right? Okay, I’m joking. While it’s difficult to thoroughly discuss accessibility in an hour, I hope you get a sense of what it’s about and impart some knowledge on what I believe are some of the important pieces.</p>

						<h2>Introduction</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>So, a quick introduction. My name is Cynthia Ng. I currently work as the Content Coordinator for the National Network for Equitable Library Service (or the NNELS project) at the BC Libraries Cooperative, a non-profit organization that provides centralized services for libraries, primarily in BC, but actually, across Canada. If you’re in a class that gets training or talks about Evergreen, then you’ve probably met some of my coworkers. While my main focus in my current position is getting books in accessible formats added to our collection for print disabled readers, I’ve also been working on websites and making them accessible, usable, and responsive for a few years.</p>
							<p>If you want to know more about what I do either in or outside of libraries, then you can read about me on my about.me page (which is just about.me/cynthiang) or if you really want to read _all_ about me, you can go to my blog, where I have a full about me page.</p>
							<p>I _have_ spoken at a number of conferences and done some webinars on accessibility (so I hope I’m not boring anyone who’s managed to see or read one of my previous presentations), and what I’m known for, when presenting, is...</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Having established that, normally we might consider defining a disability. That’s actually a really hard task, but we can look at the different types of disabilities.</p>

						<h2>Numbers <br>or Why Should You Care?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Frequently, people ask why they should care about accessibility. Here you are, sitting in class, and the person at the front says “Listen up, this is important”, but how often does that actually make you care?</p>
							<p>So let’s have a simple exercise: I want everyone to stand up. ((Make everyone sit down minus 10%)). Look around, because these are your friends, your classmates, your future colleagues and theoretically, this is the number of them just in this one classroom that have a disability.</p>

						<h2>Getting Buy-in</h2>

								<li>add value to the institution. - because you have a better website, it benefits more people (e.g. captions to help people with varying language skills), loads more quickly in browsers, requires less bandwidth, is easier to maintain and update, tends to have a higher return in search engines, and higher compatibility with various software and hardware.</li>

						<h2>Designing for Assistive Technology</h2>

							<p>Assuming at this point, we have buy-in, we’re going to make our website accessible. How do we do that? Well, let’s also assume that we have a working website, but we want to make sure it works with the technology that those with disabilities use. This group of technology is usually referred to as assistive technology, but what is it?</p>

						<h2>Universal Design</h2>

							<p>Here’s a thought exercise, which I’ll give you a few moments to think about. Other than wheelchair users, what groups of people might need to use a ramp like this?</p>
							<p>Other than wheelchair users, there are many other that find ramps useful or even necessary, such as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>parents with strollers,</li>
								<li>seniors with mobility walkers, and</li>
								<li>anything else with wheels.</li>

						<p>With that in mind, let’s assume you know what you want to build and who you want to build it for.</p>
						<p>When developing a website, you can tackle some of the technology challenges by using these key strategies: minimal load time, progressive enhancement, mobiel first, and responsive design.</p>

							<p>According to HTTP Archive, the average website is 2.2 MB, which means over 6 seconds. When you think about it, 6 seconds is a long time for a website to load. ((Count aloud))</p>

						<p>When building a website, the most basic component is the content, especially the text and the few necessary images. Then, add colours, layout, and other presentation aspects, but do it with the lightest technology. The idea here is to make it work in all browsers and platforms. Once you’re sure of that, add the fancy bits, possibly making it load after the page has already rendered to make it even faster.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Mobile first can help with a lot more than just load time, because...</p>
						<p>Mobile first is about prioritizing and focusing everything, including content, interactive elements, and layout, so that you can fit the most important parts on a mobile screen. It’s almost like progressive enhancement, where you start with the basics and most important and then you add to it. So you should see the most important content on a small screen, and as you consider larger screen sizes, you can show more content. Which brings us to...</p>

						<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
						<img class="fragment" src="images/responsive-caperbc.png" alt="website at three different sizes">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Responsive design is about making a site provide the information the user is looking for regardless of the screen size.</p>
							<p>So using CSS, we can code the site to show the the information we think the user is looking for, and at specific screen sizes, the CSS changes to show or expand more pieces of the website.</p>

							<p>Example: site title gets bigger &amp; show subtitle; signup &amp; login button in one line; logo appears; two column middle section; menu expands; logo becomes full size &amp; lower middle into 3 columns; see background colour</p>
							<p>An exercise for you: choose, outside of BC, a public library, or higher education website (which includes academic libraries), any. Look next to you so that you’re not choosing the same website as the one or two people next to you. We’re going to do a couple of exercises, so leave it open in your browser.</p>
							<p>The first exercise: check to see if it’s responsive by changing the size of the browser window.</p>
							<p>And I just threw in a couple of resources for you to look at later.</p>

					<h2>"Special" Considerations</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When trying to make a website usable for everyone, there are a few considerations, which I label “special” because many people are not aware of or don’t think about these issues.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Colour Contrast</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The first one I’ll touch on is colour contrast. Have you ever tried to read black text on a grey background? A higher background and text contrast helps not only those who are colour blind or have low vision, it also helps in extreme lighting environments. Ever try to read something on your phone with the sun shining on it? Well you’re more likely to be successful when you’re looking at something with a high contrast.</p>
						<p>We’ll come back to this again later, so we’ll move on for now.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Keyboard Accessibility</h3>
					<img src="http://cynng.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/wp-theme-input-focus.png" alt="search field with outline" class="fragment">
					<p class="fragment"><a href="http://caperbc.ca/">Demo</a></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Every element that a user can interact with should be accessible using only a keyboard and also visually show the user what they are focused on; namely links and form inputs, including search bars.</p>
						<p>show caper example</p>
						<p>Exercise: Using the same website from the last example, try using the tab key on your keyboard to move from one interactive element to another. You can usually tell if you’re moving from one link to another by the display in the bottom left corner that shows the address of where a link goes. As you tab through, can you see what you’re focused on? Do you get stuck anywhere? If so, that’s called a keyboard trap. What about if you click inside the search? Is there anything to indicate focus?</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Forms</h3>
					<p><a href="http://www.maxability.co.in/2015/03/form-elements-accessibility/">Form Elements and Accessibility</a></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Additionally, forms should have labels, even if they are visually hidden.</p>
						<p>Forms can get complex, so if you’re interested, you can read up on form best practices and accessibility.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Skip Links</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>You might have noticed that when I was tabbing through, you saw links pop up in the top left corner. The ones that you saw are what are called “skip links”. These are links that you can’t normally see, which allows users to skip the parts of the website the repeat from page to page, namely from the top of the page to the menu, and then from the menu to the content.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Media</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Images: alt=""</li>
							<li class="fragment">Audio: transcript</li>
							<li class="fragment">Video: transcript</li>
							<li class="fragment">Video: captions</li>
							<li class="fragment">Video: descriptive audio</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Anytime you have some kind of media, whether that be images, audio, or video, you should have a text-based alternative.</p>
							<p>With images, you would use alternative text or “alt text”. When the image is purely decorative, or the message is already in text format, you don’t actually need it. There are lots of articles, and flow charts that will help you determine when you need it and when you don’t.</p>
							<p>With audio and video, you will want to have captions, or a transcript. You also want to make sure that your audio and video do not automatically play.</p>
							<p>Let’s do another exercise: can someone tell me which website they have open? The one you were using for the other exercises? [pull up site] Does anyone notice anything wrong? Does anything autoplay on this site? [carousel] That’s right.</p>
							<p>Usually called carousels or image sliders, they are rampant on websites.</p>

						<p>I just want to briefly touch on documents, because they’re so prevalent.</p>
						<p>If you ever need to create or edit documents, simply follow best practices and you should be fine. If you’re making a PDF, create it from your document and you should be fine on that front too.</p>
						<p>Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, as well as Adobe Acrobat, do have accessibility checkers built-in that can help you as well.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>At the very basic of website testing is making sure it works across browsers and platforms. More specific to accessibility, you can use automated methods or tools.</p>
							<p>Evaluation tools allow you to check conformance to guidelines. For example,</p>
							<ul>
								<li>HTML Codesniffer (bookmarklet) - check against WCAG, including when logged in</li>
								<li>WCAG Contrast Checker (Firefox plugin)</li>
								<li>WAVE Toolbar - view as text-only, outline only, etc.</li>
								<li>For more, check the W3C Web Accessibility Tools list</li>
							</ul>
							<p>There are also simulation tools allow you to simulate certain conditions or environments. For example,</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Fangs - a Firefox plugin, which emulates a screen reader by providing what would be read in text form</li>
								<li>Vischeck - which processes images to simulate colour blindness. (Vischeck also provides a tool called Daltonize, which attempts to correct images.)</li>
								<li>Go ahead, go to colorfilter address and try a website. If there are lots of images, it might take a little bit of time and the layout may not look exactly the same, but this should give you an idea of what it’s like.</li>

							<p>If you can’t find users, since JAWS and some other accessibility software can be quite specialized, sometimes requiring special training, ask others for help.

						<h2>Training and Documentation</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>A big part of getting buy-in is to get other people involved. You want to make accessibility part of everyone’s job. Change their mindset by making them accountable.</p>
							<p>A common trend is that library staff are using web-based systems to create and maintain content relevant to their areas in the organization. For example, someone in collections will write and update the collections policy. The content they write affects users, so making sure the content is accessible is part of their job.</p>

						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Use headers properly</li>

						</ol>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Other than to write clearly and concisely (because our users don’t want to read whole paragraphs to get the answer they want), I provide these points to keep in mind:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Use headers - I tell them to use headers like they would in a report</li>
								<li>Use descriptive links - pretending the only context a user has is what page they’re on</li>
								<li>Use tables for displaying data (not for layout purposes)</li>
								<li>Describe images that is, use alt text if needed (GO DOWN) e.g. alt text decision flow chart</li>
								<li>If you embed audio/video, add a link to it too - for example, if they embed a youtube video, add a link to the youtube page as well</li>
							</ol>
