						<h2>What is Web Accessibility?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>We’re here today to talk about accessibility, but what <em>is</em> accessibility?</p>
							<p>One definition, and what seems to be the most common one is that</p>
						</aside>

					<section>
						<blockquote>Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web. <p class="quoted">- W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</p></blockquote>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Having established that, we might look at defining a disability. That’s actually a really hard task, but we can look at the different types of disabilities.</p>

						<h2>Types of Disabilities</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">visual</li>
							<li class="fragment">auditory</li>

							<li class="fragment">touch</li>
							<li class="fragment">learning</li>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>visual: other than blindness, this might also refer to people who have difficulty with judging distances and hand-eye coordination</li>
								<li>auditory: other than deafness, this might also refer to other hearing issues, such as having difficulty focusing on a single voice</li>
								<li>physical/motor: examples include not being able to grip something or problems with precise movements</li>
								<li>touch: namely this refers to a lack of sensation with touch</li>
								<li>learning: is a rather large umbrella term, but includes dyslexia and other reading disabilities, as well as dysphasia and related issues with writing</li>

						<h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>People with a disability are a minority, and not all of them need special consideration for web accessibility, right? While that may be true, you might be surprised by some of the facts.</p>

						<h3>Policy &amp; Legislation</h3>
						<p>Federal Departments &amp; Ontario: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>In Canada, only the federal government departments and the public institutions of Ontario are legislated to meet web accessibility guidelines.</p>
							<p>However, many organizations or at times, municipalities will also have policies or mandates that have to be followed relating to accessibility. Nevertheless,</p>

						<h2>Getting Buy-in</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>People frequently ask me how to get buy-in from others, because they might be convinced that we should care about accessibility and do something about it, but too often, accessibility is put aside because it’s too difficult, time consuming, or due to a belief that “accessible websites are ugly.”</p>
							<p>This last excuse is not true. I mean yes, some accessible websites are ugly, but in the same way that some websites are ugly regardless of the level of accessibility. If anything, the most accessible websites I’ve reviewed have been fairly pleasing to the eye.</p>

								<li>make sound fiscal policy, - since it improves efficiency and reduces costs while maintaining quality, avoids retrofitting, inequitable solutions, litigation; frequently fulfills grant/contract requirements - and</li>
								<li>add value to the institution. - because you have a better website, it benefits more people (e.g. captions to help people with varying language skills), loads more quickly in browsers, requires less bandwidth, is easier to maintain and update, tends to have a higher return in search engines, and higher compatibility with various software and hardware.</li>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Whether you want to, or because you’re told to, half the battle seems to simply be figuring out your approach.</p>
							<p>If, like many others, you see accessibility as something at the end of a checklist, then that’s when you’ll deal with it. However, at least two usability/accessibility experts tell us to:</p>

							<p>Say as part of your approach, you want to make sure your service is accessible to all assistive technology. You start with ‘screen readers’ on your list,  and do some searching and start adding, other ‘text-to-speech’ software, ‘screen magnifiers’, ‘joysticks’, what about ‘mobile devices’ with the added accessibility features? What about ‘keyboards’ for keyboard accessibility?</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Here’s a thought exercise, which I’ll give you a few moments to think about. Other than wheelchair users, what groups of people might need to use a ramp like this?</p>
							<p>Other than wheelchair users, there are many other that find ramps useful or even necessary, such as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>parents with strollers,</li>
								<li>seniors with mobility walkers, and</li>
								<li>anything else with wheels.</li>

						<h3>Universal Design for the Web</h3>

						<h3>WCAG Universal Design Examples</h3>

							<p>multiple ways to discover content e.g. links, search box</p>
							<p>captions or transcript of audio/video (good for example for ESL, different learning styles).</p>

					<h2>Some “Special” Considerations</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>While making use of best practices and comforming to a good set of guidelines, such as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>, (along with everything else) should be enough, there are a few considerations that I want to cover because they are commonly missed or not thought about.</p>
						<p>Let’s start with</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Keyboard Accessibility</h3>
					<img src="http://cynng.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/wp-theme-input-focus.png" alt="search field with outline" class="fragment">

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Websites should always be fully accessible by a keyboard. Interactive elements should be navigable and controllable by keyboard, keyboard shortcuts should not override default behaviour, and users should always know where they are.</p>
						<p>For example, visual cues for input focus help your users regardless of whether they only use a keyboard or not, but are necessary for keyboard only users.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Skip Links</h3>
					<pre class="fragment"><code data-trim class="html">
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;a class="hide-text" href="#main"&gt;Skip to Main Content&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;nav role="navigation"&gt;
	// Menu
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;div id="main" role="main"&gt;
	 // Content
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
					</code></pre>
					<cite class="fragment">Schofield, M. (2014). ARIA for the Spec Impaired. <a href="http://ns4lib.com/aria-primer/">http://ns4lib.com/aria-primer/</a></cite>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Ideally, your source order actually has your menu below your content, but if you're constrained, skip links are useful for both keyboard only, and screen reader users. Skip links are simple links that allow users to skip repeated parts of your website, such as your header or menu.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>ARIA</h3>
					<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite</a></p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code data-trim class="html">
&lt;nav role="navigation"&gt;

					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The role attribute that you see as part of the nav and main content div is part of the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, or ARIA. Basically, it’s a way to add attributes to your code to make your site more accessible by telling a screen reader what ‘role’ your elements play.</p>
						<p>So, “navigation” says this is where the main menu or navigation is.</p>
						<p>You need to do some research on when to use these, and I have some ARIA resources listed.</p>

							<p>Media should have a text alternative. This is generally fairly straightforward.</p>

						</ul>


						<aside class="notes">
							<p>To assess your tool or service, you can use automated methods or tools. You might use a framework, such as QuailJS. Other options include evaluation tools.</p>
							<p>Evaluation tools allow you to check conformance to guidelines. For example,</p>
							<ul>
								<li>HTML Codesniffer (bookmarklet) - check against WCAG, including when logged in</li>
								<li>WCAG Contrast Checker (Firefox plugin)</li>
								<li>WAVE Toolbar - view as text-only, outline only, etc.</li>
								<li>For more, check the W3C Web Accessibility Tools list</li>
							</ul>
							<p>There are also simulation tools allow you to simulate certain conditions or environments. For example, VisCheck takes images and simulates colour blindness. (Vischeck also provides a tool called Daltonize, which attempts to correct images.). There are also some screen reader emulators, such as Fangs, which I showed you briefly earlier.</p>

						<h3>Analytics</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Numbers can’t tell you why, but they can help your assessment.</p>
							<p>For example, numbers on visits and bounces can help you decide what to further assess, what’s popular, or what’s hard to find. </p>
							<p>Rather than pure numbers, trends from analytics can be very helpful. Usage throughout a day, week, or year can help you decide on when to make changes, or promote things. It might even indicate when you’re more likely to get users for your usability tests.</p>

						<li class="fragment">Paid Testing (e.g. VIRN)</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>However, numbers and tests is not an indication that your website is actually accessible or usable. Nothing can replace actual user and usability testing throughout  development.</p>
						<p>This is where usability testing comes in, which can be as simple or complex as you make it. </p>
						<p>Simple ones include a “5 second test” where for example, you ask a user where they might click on a home page given a specific task. I also want to reiterate that testing and assessment should not all be done at the end, but throughout the process. The “5 second test” I’ve described is a great test to do while you’re still at the design stage.</p>
						<p>More complex usability testing might involved scheduling specific individuals to answer questions and complete tasks in a lab setting where audio and video are recorded in a longer session.</p>
						<p>Nevertheless, user testing can also be something in between. Guerilla testing is very popular whereby a laptop is setup with screen, video, and audio recording in a small area of a high traffic area, asking users who pass by to sit down for 10-15 minutes.</p>
						<p>If you have some money, but not the time and in-house resources, there are lots of companies that will run usability tests for you.</p>
						<p>If you want to specifically have disabled users test your service, I encourage you to collaborate with another department or team. If that’s not possible, Canadian organizations, such as the Vision Impaired Resource Network (VIRN), will do accessibility assessments on websites for a fee.</p>

							<li class="fragment">Describe images if needed</li>
							<li class="fragment">Make and choose videos with captions, and add a link if you embed them</li>
						</ol>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>With the rise of the CMS, fewer organizations have a single person writing content for the website. When staff in an organization are restricted within their roles on a CMS, there is no reason that staff members should not be empowered to write and edit the content for the areas they are responsible for, and fix minor errors in other areas.</p>
							<p>While you cannot control what other people write, you can encourage best practices by providing a few simple guidelines. By giving staff examples and resources, you can build content best practices into the writing process.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Be clear and concise - because users don’t want to read whole paragraphs to get the answer they want</li>
								<li>Use headers and tables properly - I tell them to use headers like they would in a report, and tables should only be for displaying data (not for layout purposes)</li>
								<li>Use descriptive links - pretending the only context a user has is what page they’re on</li>
								<li>Describe images if needed (GO DOWN) e.g. alt text decision flow chart</li>
								<li>Last but not least, Make and choose videos with captions, and add a link if you embed them</li>
