						<p>If you attended the session I did in the spring, the first part of this session will be review, but I’ll be brief and focus on the most important points. If you haven’t seen the previous session, I would highly encourage you to view it if you want to know more about how to make digital content more accessible, as today, I’ll be focusing on the overall structure of a website rather than content.</p>

						<h2>What is Web Accessibility?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>We’re here today to talk about accessibility, but what <em>is</em> web accessibility?</p>
							<p>One definition, and what seems to be the most common one is that</p>

						<h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>People with a disability are a minority, and not all of them need special consideration for web accessibility, right? While that may be true, you might be surprised by some of the facts.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Disability > Minority*</h3>
						<cite>* Based on 2010 US census <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/p70-131.pdf">percentage of total population with a disability</a>, and the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf">percentage of total population of minorities.</a></cite>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The number of people with a disability is larger than any one group of ethnic or visible minority. That’s a lot of people.</p>

					<h2>Policy &amp; Legislation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">The Rehabilitation Act (Section 504 and 508)</li>
						<li class="fragment">Americans with Disabilities Act</li>
						<li class="fragment">state legislation</li>
						<li class="fragment">organizations, grants, etc.</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>In the US, there are two federal Acts in particular to consider.</p>
						<p>The Rehabilitation Act has sections that legislate accessibility in federals departments as well as equiavelent access in all federally funded programs.</p>
						<p>ADA, which basically provides civil rights to people with disabilities much like the Civil Rights Act would apply based on race or religion.</p>
						<p>There may also be state legislation, though I admit that I haven't found any references to web accessibility in Florida.</p>
						<p>Many organizations also have guidelines or policies around equal or equivalent access to all users, and many grants and other sources of funding may also stipulate equivalent access.</p>

						<li class="fragment">accessible</li>
						<li class="fragment">usable</li>

					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>There are lots of benefits to making websites and digital services accessible including making your service more .... I won’t list them all here or go into details, so again, if you haven’t seen it, check out the webinar I did in the spring where I spent a good portion of time talking about getting buy in and more benefits of accessibility.</p>
						<p>For our purposes here, I’m going to assume that *you’re* at least convinced and have at least a minimal amount of time to implement and integrate accessibility into your digital services.</p>
						<p>Of course, knowing *why* doesn’t tell you *how* to approach accessibility.</p>

						<h2>Approach to Accessibility</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Whether you or your team wants to, or because you’re told to, half the battle seems to simply be figuring out your approach.</p>
							<p>If, like many others, you see accessibility as something at the end of a checklist, then that’s when you’ll deal with it. However, at least two usability/accessibility experts tell us to:</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Peanut butter is tasty, but not necessarily a big help in this case.</p>

						<h2>Designing for Assistive Technology</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>While I’m using a website as the basis for this talk, I want you to think about how the general ideas might apply to other programs or services beyond websites, beyond even technology-based services, maybe think about the information desk, an exhibit, or even story time.</p>
							<p>When referring to making digital services accessible, it is my experience that people will always ask that the service works with “assistive technology”.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Example Development Process</h3>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Develop the website.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Add or adjust things to work with screen readers.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Launch (may happen before #2).</li>
						</ol>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Let’s start with the assumption that we want to redesign or develop a new website. This is a vast oversimplification of the whole process, but it is my experience that 1. Then, the team will be asked that the service works with “assistive technology”, but which they mean screen readers 2. And then they'll launch. For the moment, we'll set aside the issue about not doing testing with users before launching, and look at point #2.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What is Assistive Technology?</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Frequently, when discussing assistive technology, people mean screen readers. However, while screen readers are frequently used by those with visual impairments, they are not the only group of people using assistive technology, nor obviously, is it the only type... </p>
							<p>So what is assistive technology?</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<blockquote>an umbrella term that includes [...] devices for people with disabilities [...] by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the technology needed to accomplish such tasks. <p class="quoted">- Wikipedia</p></blockquote>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Please think about this for a moment, about how it applies to your work and your organization. How might this one statement change the development process for websites, technology projects, and other services? [wait]</p>
							<p>We are not creating services for a specific piece of technology, we can’t.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>There are too many potential devices and ways people are using devices to do that. We are creating for potential situations, because conditions including physical or environmental ones can be temporary. If you've ever broken a wrist or arm, or ever tried to read on a screen while it's sunny outside without adjusting your screen brightness, then you know what it means to be affected by temporary conditions.</p>
							<p>So how do you design for accessibility, if that includes all technology?</p>

						<h2>Universal Design</h2>

						<h3>Universal Design Principles</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">equitable</li>
							<li class="fragment">flexible</li>
							<li class="fragment">simple</li>
							<li class="fragment">intuitive</li>
							<li class="fragment">low effort</li>
							<li class="fragment">approachable</li>
							<li class="fragment">usable</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Universal Design follows a few guidelines summarized by these key words...</p>
							<p>Accessibility is simply one piece of the puzzle along with standards &amp; best practices, usability, user experience, and more.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Examples from Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Each page should have a title.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Have consistent navigation.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Have a meaningful order to content.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Provide multiple ways to discover content.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Captions or transcript of audio/video.</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Even looking at the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, many guidelines apply not only for users with disabilities, but all our users.</p>
							<p>...provide multiple ways to discover content e.g. links, search box, and captions or transcript of audio/video (good for example for ESL, different learning styles).</p>
							<p>So the goal here is to make your services accessible and usable for your whole audience, without trying to specifically accommodate for one group. Hopefully, as I go through some guidelines and suggestions, it will occur to you what groups of people might benefit other than people with disabilities.</p>

						<h2>Building Universal (Web) Services</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Of course, the question still remains, how do you implement universal design?</p>
							<p>Honestly, the best answer I can give you is that</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<blockquote>It is important for designers to formulate and adhere to usable design processes and guidelines throughout the entire cycle of development so that the product or service is accessible and universally usable for all.<p class="quoted">- Constantine Stephanidis</p></blockquote>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>I realize that’s still a very vague answer. So let’s change the question. If someone came up to me and said “Tell me, exactly what do I need to do to make my new website universal?”</p>
						</aside>

					<h2>Ask Your Users</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I would probably still start with the broader perspective and a reminder that you need to be doing the different types of exercises, tests, and studies, whereby you get your users involved as much as possible.</p>
						<p>Throughout the process, the idea is to keep in mind that your users and the way they access and interact with your services are very diverse.</p>

					<h2>Challenges</h2>

						<p>Thus, you are faced with three major challenges:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>tech variety: hardware, software, network;</li>
							<li>user diversity: skills, knowledge, disabilities, personality (e.g. exploratory vs. cautionary), environmental conditions (mobility, sunlight, noise), literacy, culture, etc.; and</li>

						<blockquote>Worry about the less capable first. <p class="quoted">- Swwweet</p></blockquote>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>From there, you add any fancy bits, typically using JavaScript or third-party modules, where you want to consider using accessible ones, particularly UI frameworks, such as jQuery UI.</p>
							<p>Progressive enhancement can also help you create smaller sites that load faster, and counterintuitively, move development time to newer browsers by focusing on what they can do with less effort.</p>

							<p>Finally, it makes sense that you would present more information to those who can see more on their screen at once, which is where responsive design comes in.</p>
							<p>I won’t go into detail on any of these practices, because each of these are sessions in and of themselves, but these are also not new practices anymore, so if you’re not familiar with them, there is certainly a lot of material for you to read.</p>

						<h2>Some “Special” Considerations</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>While making use of best practices and comforming to a good set of guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), (along with everything else) should be enough, there are a few considerations that I want to cover because they are commonly missed or not thought about.</p>
							<p>Let’s start with</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Media</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Images: alt=""</li>
							<li class="fragment">Audio: transcript</li>
							<li class="fragment">Video: transcript</li>
							<li class="fragment">Video: captions</li>
							<li class="fragment">Video: descriptive audio</li>
							<li class="fragment">More A/V: controls, no autoplay</li>
							<li class="fragment">Warning! Check the carousel.</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>I covered media in quite some detail in the spring session, but just to review...</p>
							<p>Images need the alt text attribute, but if it's decorative or does not convey any extra meaning, then it can be empty.</p>
							<p>Audio and video should always have an accessible equivalent. Typically, this takes the form of a text transcript, but can also include captions and descriptive audio.</p>
							<p>Additional considerations for audio/visual are to ensure there are basic controls to play, pause, and change volume; and that they do not automatically start playing when the page is visited.</p>
							<p>While these features are typically available by default on audio and video, websites commonly have carousels or image sliders, which do not always have controls, typically autoplay, and may have other accessibility issues. I'm not saying not to use them, but be cautious.</p>
						</aside>

						<h3>Skip Links</h3>
						<pre class="fragment"><code data-trim class="html">
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;a class="hide-text" href="#main"&gt;Skip to Main Content&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;nav role="navigation"&gt;
	// Menu
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;div id="main" role="main"&gt;
	 // Content
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
						</code></pre>
						<cite class="fragment">Schofield, M. (2014). ARIA for the Spec Impaired. <a href="http://ns4lib.com/aria-primer/">http://ns4lib.com/aria-primer/</a></cite>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Ideally, your source order actually has your menu below your content, but if you're constrained, skip links are useful for both keyboard only, and screen reader users. Skip links are simple links that allow users to skip repeated parts of your website, such as your header or menu.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Keyboard Accessibility</h3>
						<img class="fragment" src="http://cynng.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/wp-theme-input-focus.png" alt="search field with outline" class="fragment">
						<img class="fragment" src="images/skip-link-example.png" alt="search field with outline" class="fragment">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Websites should always be fully accessible by a keyboard. Interactive elements should be navigable and controllable by keyboard, keyboard shortcuts should not override default behaviour, and users should always know where they are.</p>
							<p>For example, visual cues for input focus help your users regardless of whether they only use a keyboard or not, but are necessary for keyboard only users.</p>
							<p>And if you have hidden links, such as skip links, they should show up when there is focus on it.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>ARIA</h3>
						<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite</a></p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code data-trim class="html">
&lt;div role="alert"&gt;
	// warning
&lt;/div&gt;
						</code></pre>
						<cite class="fragment">For more on ARIA, check out the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA Overview</a></cite>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, or ARIA, is a way to add attributes to your code to make your site more accessible by telling a screen reader what ‘role’ your elements play.</p>
							<p>So, "alert" tells the user that this div section contains an important, usually time sensitive, message. For example, a maintenance notice of when the system will be down.</p>
							<p>Many elements in HTML5 have implied roles, such as 'nav' for navigation or menu, so you would only use ARIA when there are blocks that are ambiguous.</p>

					<h2>Assessing Your Service</h2>
					<h3 class="fragment">Simulation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><a href="http://vischeck.com/">VisCheck</a></li>
						<li class="fragment"><a href="http://www.standards-schmandards.com/projects/fangs/">Fangs</a></li>
					</ul>

					<h3 class="fragment">Evaluation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C validator</a></li>
						<li class="fragment"><a href="http://squizlabs.github.com/HTML_CodeSniffer/">HTML Codesniffer</a> (bookmarklet)</li>
						<li class="fragment"><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/wcag-contrast-checker/">WCAG Contrast Checker</a> (Firefox plugin)</li>
						<li class="fragment"><a href="http://wave.webaim.org/toolbar/">WAVE Toolbar</a></li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I mentioned a testing framework earlier, Quail, and there are others, sometimes built into software, such as Eclipse. However, if you’re not comfortable with testing frameworks, you could choose a set of assessment tools, of which there are two types.</p>
						<p>Simulation tools allow you to simulate certain conditions or environments. For example, VisCheck takes images and simulates colour blindness. (Vischeck also provides a tool called Daltonize, which attempts to correct images.) There are also some screen reader emulators, such as Fangs, which you saw earlier.</p>
						<p>Evaluation tools allow you to check conformance to guidelines. For example,</p>
						<ul>
							<li>W3C validator to validate code, making sure the syntax is correct and conforms to the latest specification</li>
							<li>HTML Codesniffer (bookmarklet) - check against WCAG, including when logged in</li>
							<li>WCAG Contrast Checker (Firefox plugin)</li>
							<li>WAVE Toolbar - view as text-only, outline only, etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Nevertheless, these are automated tools and passing all of these tests does not mean that your website is actually accessible or usable. Nothing can replace actual user and usability testing throughout  development.</p>

					<h2>Guidelines for Your Content Creators</h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment">Be clear and concise.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Use headers and tables properly.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Use descriptive links.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Describe images if needed.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Make or choose videos with captions.</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>With the rise of the CMS, fewer organizations have a single person writing content for the website. When staff in an organization are restricted within their roles on a CMS, there is no reason that staff members should not be empowered to write and edit the content for the areas they are responsible for, and fix minor errors in other areas.</p>
						<p>While you cannot control what other people write, you can encourage best practices by providing a few simple guidelines. By giving staff examples and resources, you can build content best practices into the writing process.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Be clear and concise - because users don’t want to read whole paragraphs to get the answer they want</li>
							<li>Use headers and tables properly - I tell them to use headers like they would in a report, and tables should only be for displaying data (not for layout purposes)</li>
							<li>Use descriptive links - pretending the only context a user has is what page they’re on</li>
							<li>Describe images if needed e.g. alt text decision flow chart</li>
							<li>Last but not least, Make or choose videos with captions</li>
						</ol>
						<p>That's it. Five simple guidelines. Emphasize that the guidelines are for everyone’s benefit, and that the accessibility and usability is a shared responsibility. The details on these guidelines is the spring webinar covered, so check that out for more.</p>

					<h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance-claims">WCAG Conformance Claims</a></li>
						<li class="fragment"><a href="https://www.access8878.co.uk/getting-started-with-bs-8878/creating-an-accessibility-statement.aspx">Access 8878 Accessibility Statement Template</a></li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Now that your staff have some guidance, what about your users? While not required, one of the great ways to be transparent and show your organization’s efforts in supporting equitable access is to have an accessibility statement.</p>
						<p>It also helps to clarify for users what to expect depending on how much of your service relies on third-party services.</p>
						<p>WCAG includes a section on writing conformance claims, and the Access 8878 site also provides a template based on the UK’s BS 8878 Web Accessibility Code of Practice.</p>
