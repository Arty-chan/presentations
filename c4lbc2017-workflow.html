					<h2>Some Context</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>To begin, I would like to give everyone a little bit of context.</p>
						<p>I don’t think I have ever had a job description that specifically says to “manage and review workflows”, but many of my positions have involved overseeing operational work involving multiple people where work would not be done if there were no workflow established. This seems like a fairly common thing, but where the problems lie is when these very same workflows are never reviewed.</p>
						<p>How do you know that the work is successful? That nothing is being dropped? Can the workflow be improved to make work easier? More efficient, and thus faster? Is the most appropriate person doing each task? Is the work appropriately divided? Is there a designated backup for each task? How do you ensure the backup knows how to do the work?</p>
						<p>In the course of all this, I started to look at ways we can easily understand and analyze workflow. There are various ways that can help review workflows, and hopefully one or more of these methods can help you answer these questions. The methods I have chosen are also meant to be done in a reasonable amount of time, with minimal resources and without being overly complex.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Understanding Workflow</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Obviously, different methods will work better depending on the specific workflow you are reviewing, the staff, and your organization. How many people you want involved may also determine which methods you decide to use.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Flowchart</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>One of the simplest ways to look at a workflow is to draw a flowchart based on your knowledge of how something is done, whether it’s a set process, or documenting how decisions are made. You might do it, or get someone else on staff to draw the flowchart depending on who is most familiar with the process.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/production-workflow-synth-only.png" alt="flowchart example">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>This first example is a fairly set process in how an accessible format book is produced. This process could be drawn in a straight line as it’s a linear process, but it can still be useful to review the steps taken. In particular, despite the linearity of the process, there are notes regarding the fact that some steps only occur of the original format of the material is from print.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/caperbc-formats-guide-draft1.png" alt="decision flowchart example">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>A second example here is a decision-style flowchart. Again, this is a fairly simple process, but it can help to visualize decision making process, especially for those who may be less familiar with the process.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/workflow-overview.png" alt="overview flowchart example">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>You might even have multiple flowcharts, one which provides an overview of a workflow, with separate flowcharts detailing each part.</p>
							<p>The flowchart you see here provides an overview of a request process. Each step that is in a blue box actually has another flowchart to provide the process for that specific step. For example, the production step is detailed by the first flowchart that I showed.</p>

						<h2>Task Analysis</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Task analysis is a methodology used frequently in usability studies and as a user experience exercise. Depending on how a task analysis is done, it might include recording and analyzing task frequency, duration, and complexity. Frequently, a task is also broken down into multiple subtasks. While there are different ways of recording the information, commonly, how the task is completed is put into a form similar to a flowchart.</p>

							<p>This is a task analysis of how a user requests an interlibrary loan online through the website. The images you see are screenshots from the various pages a user sees while going through the request process, with arrows to show which screens the user will see depending on the decisions they make, and the rest are handwritten notes about the user’s process. Credit here goes to Matthew Reidsma at Grand Valley State University, who performed this task analysis and has since streamlined the process and improved the user experience around the online ILL process significantly.</p>

						<h2>Journey Sheet</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Flowcharts and task analyses work well when you know and understand the whole process, but what happens when you don’t? Obviously, you need something that helps you identify all the steps in a workflow.</p>
							<p>Honestly, there is probably an actual name for this method of looking at workflows, but I could not find one, so I have come to call them journey sheets.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/book-journey-blank.png" alt="example blank journey sheet">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The idea is that you have a sheet of paper which will go from one person to the next, and as it passes to each person, they write down their name and their tasks. This method works particularly well if you have a specific item, print or digital, that the journey sheet follows.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Types of Material</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Hardcover</li>
							<li class="fragment">Trade Paperpack</li>
							<li class="fragment">Children's Fiction</li>
							<li class="fragment">Children's Non-Fiction</li>
							<li class="fragment">Magazine</li>
							<li class="fragment">Newspaper</li>
							<li class="fragment">DVD</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>When we did this exercise at my work, we were looking at the workflow for new materials in how they are handled and processed, so we did a journey sheet for each type of material:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Hardcover (with and without hold)</li>
								<li>Trade Paperpack</li>
								<li>Children's Fiction</li>
								<li>Children's Non-Fiction</li>
								<li>Magazine</li>
								<li>Newspaper</li>
								<li>DVD</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We opted not to do CD or audiobook, because we knew it was a similar process as DVD, nor mass market paperback since it's similar to trade paperback, but even simpler, and I did not want to overwhelm staff with how many we were doing.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/book-journey-example.jpg" alt="example completed journey sheet">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The sheets themselves have brief instructions and an example at the top, with information on who to contact. Once left with the staff member who does receiving, the sheets were attached as soon as an appropriate item came in and followed the item throughout the process until it was shelved in the public area, at which time the sheets were returned to me. One of the reasons I decided on journey sheets was because part of the process involves another department and involves many different staff members, so the journey sheets seemed like the easiest way to see what was happening with material.</p>
							<p>Some people have asked me about having staff put a date as to when they receive it, which is certainly an option. However, in our case, we were more concerned with the process rather than how long the process took, and we did not want staff to feel as if the speed of their work was being evaluated. So, really, it depends on whether timing is something you want to review.</p>
							<p>If you decide to use this method, be warned that sheets may get lost, so you will want a contingency plan of how to handle what happens. The one sheet we thought lost was accidentally kept with the book, so it came back weeks later when the borrower returned the book.</p>
							<p>After the sheets were completed, I did a bit of analysis. What was most interesting was seeing how many people handled an item. In many places, the number of people handling an item is not necessarily an issue where items stay on trucks and are simply wheeled from one person to the next. However, at my workplace, due to space constraints, the less people that handle an item, the less time is potentially wasted simply moving an item from one person to the next, especially in Technical Services.</p>
							<p>A journey sheet can be used with digital items as well, as long as it’s clear which item the sheet is “attached” to, and that the sheet moves along with it.</p>

						<h2>Swim Lanes</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Swim lane diagramming can be a great way of visualizing the kind of information gathered from a journey sheet. Whether you go through the journey sheet exercise or not, swim lanes allow you to draw the steps in a workflow showing who handles each step by putting the tasks in different rows or columns (depending on whether you draw the swim lanes horizontally or vertically), representing different individuals or departments.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Approvals.jpg" alt="example of swim lanes diagram showing steps done by different departments">
						<cite>Kerr, P. (2006). Swimlanes flowchart of a business process. <em>Wikimedia Commons</em>. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Approvals.jpg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Approvals.jpg</a> Public Domain.</cite>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The example shown here is done vertically where each column is a different department and each flowchart step shows which department is doing the work, but again, it can be done horizontally with rows instead and with individuals instead of departments, depending on the information you have and at what level you are reviewing the process.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/swimlane-example.jpg" alt="">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Using the results from the book journey sheet, we can rewrite the information by creating a lane for each individual and even group them by department. Now, we can easily see that the item goes through 3 departments, 7 individuals, and most significantly, that it passes by the same person twice. Based on this information about the current process, we can review the workflow and see where we might make improvements.</p>

					<h2>Questions to Ask</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Does the order make sense?</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>After gathering the information, we need to ask questions about the process.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Does the order make sense?</li>
							<li>Which steps are flexible in the order? Conditional upon other steps being completed?</li>
							<li>Can specific steps be done more efficiently? (Is something done manually? Is there new technology that can help? Possibly automate part or all of it?)</li>

					<h2>The Ideal Workflow</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Based on the answer to these questions, you will want to outline what you think would be the ideal workflow.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Reorganization</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>If you don’t have an ideal workflow in mind already, you might consider transferring the information to a format where you can rearrange each step.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/excel-reorg.png" alt="example workflow reorganization in excel">

						<aside class="notes">

						<h2>Card Sort Variants</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>If you are still having difficulty coming up with an ideal workflow, consider doing a variation of a card sort.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/closed-card-sort.jpg" alt="steps of closed card sort">
						<cite>Rosenfeld Media. (2009). CS002: Figure 1.2. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/3344341528">https://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/3344341528</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0</a></cite>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The basic idea behind a card sort is that you write each item on an index card or sticky note. You then have individuals or groups of people organize each card. In a closed card sort as you see here, the categories are predetermined. In an open card sort, there are no predetermined categories, and allow participants to group cards into as many or few piles as they think necessary.</p>
							<p>A card sort is a type of exercise typically found in web design to help create an information architecture for a website. Nevertheless, we can use variants of a card sort for trying to find an ideal workflow as well.</p>
							<p>In the context of a workflow, you would write each task on a card or sticky note. There are then a couple of different exercises you can do, either separately or together in one session.</p>
							<p>Either individually or as a group, the first exercise is to pile or group together the tasks that should be done together or at the same time. For example, a library’s name is stamped or stickered onto an item, and you might want a branch’s stamp or sticker to be added to an item at the same time.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/workflow-sticky-notes.jpg" alt="re-organized workflow using sticky notes">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The second exercise is to put each group of tasks in order. Some tasks have to come before others, but there is usually some flexibility for the order of tasks. As the group of tasks are ordered, think about efficiencies. For example, one of the tasks we wanted to move to an earlier part of the workflow at my workplace was tattle-taping, because it takes about 3 days to set. By moving it to be one of the first tasks done, we no longer had to wait for the tattle-tape to set before sending it to circulation.</p>
							<p>There are advantages of doing it as a group including that others may have ideas you have not thought of, and that it provides an opportunity for staff to provide input to the review.</p>

					<section>
						<h2>Getting to the Ideal</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Hopefully in going through various exercises, you will have come up with an ideal process.</p>
							<p>You might even consider starting with the ideal before you analyze current processes so that you are not unduly influenced by the current work environment.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/accessible-production-workflow.jpg" alt="example workflow of accessible format production">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>However you get there, the ideal workflow may or may not work with the current staff, resources, and work environment. Other times, it may be that the ideal workflow is quite different from the current workflow. In these cases, you will want to develop flowcharts representing intermediate steps to get from the current workflow to the ideal one.</p>
							<p>Finally, always check in with staff to see if they can think of any issues that you had not thought of before implementing.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/workflow-timeline.png" alt="example workflow reorganization in excel">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Once you're ready to implement the new workflow, consider a staggered implementation that reflect the workflows that you may have developed as intermediate steps towards the ideal. If you can, break it down even further, so that you make one or two changes at once, then give staff time to adjust before doing more changes. The bigger the change, the more time staff will need to get used to the new workflow.</p>
							<p>For example, this timeline shows transferring duties from a Library Assistant 3 to two different Library Assistant 2s. It then gives each Library Assistant 2 a month's time before shifting more work from the Library Assistant 3 to them. What follows is ample time for them to get used the new duties and resulting workflow. In that following time period, there are also review sessions built-in to make sure the transition and new process is going smoothly.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Take Away</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Workflow and processes are not something that you need to or should necessarily do a big review for often, but each workflow, especially those used regularly, should be documented and understood by everyone involved. If at any time someone has questions, it becomes a good opportunity to review whether something needs to change and how it will affect the workflow as a whole even when the workflow only involves a single person. If changes are being discussed, consider if there are tools or technology to help solve any issues or improve efficiencies. Regardless, the focus should be on a balance of efficiency and quality as the ultimate goal is always to provide timely, quality service to our users.</p>
						<p>I would love to hear if anyone has done these or other workflow review exercises and how successful they were; or if anyone has used tools that has helped their work be much more efficient. If there are any questions, I would be happy to answer any now as well.</p>
